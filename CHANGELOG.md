## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Flight Recorder — Browser Dashboard:** The browser dashboard (`localhost:7391`) is now a true fixed-viewport 3-column layout. The left column streams every tool call in real-time — appearing immediately as `● PENDING` and resolving to `✓ ALLOW`, `✗ BLOCK`, or `🛡️ DLP` as decisions arrive. The feed scrolls internally and never causes the browser page to scroll. History from the current session is replayed to new browser tabs via an in-memory ring buffer (last 100 events).
- **`node9 tail` — Terminal Flight Recorder:** New command that streams live agent activity directly to the terminal. Uses a spec-compliant SSE parser (handles TCP fragmentation), filters history floods on connect, and shows a live `● …` pending indicator for slow operations (bash, SQL, agent calls). Auto-starts the daemon if it isn't running. Supports `--history` to replay recent events on connect. Output is pipeable (`node9 tail | grep DLP`).
- **Shields Panel in Browser Dashboard:** The right sidebar now shows all available shields (postgres, github, aws, filesystem) with live enable/disable toggles. Changes take effect immediately on the next tool call — no daemon restart required. Toggle state is broadcast via SSE to keep multiple open tabs in sync.
- **Improved Pending Approval Cards:** Approval cards now show an `⚠️ Action Required` header with a live countdown timer that turns red under 15 seconds. Allow/Deny buttons have clearer labels (`✅ Allow this Action` / `🚫 Block this Action`). The deny button uses a softer outlined style to reduce accidental clicks.
- **DLP Content Scanner:** Node9 now scans every tool call argument for secrets before policy evaluation. Seven built-in patterns cover AWS Access Key IDs, GitHub tokens (`ghp_`, `gho_`, `ghs_`), Slack bot tokens (`xoxb-`), OpenAI API keys, Stripe secret keys, PEM private keys, and Bearer tokens. `block`-severity patterns hard-deny the call immediately; `review`-severity patterns route through the normal race engine. Secrets are redacted to a prefix+suffix sample in all audit logs. Configurable via `policy.dlp.enabled` and `policy.dlp.scanIgnoredTools`.
- **Shield Templates:** `node9 shield enable <service>` installs a curated rule set for a specific infrastructure service. Available shields: `postgres` (blocks `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `DROP COLUMN`; reviews `GRANT`/`REVOKE`), `github` (blocks `gh repo delete`; reviews remote branch deletion), `aws` (blocks S3 bucket deletion, EC2 termination; reviews IAM and RDS changes), `filesystem` (reviews `chmod 777` and writes to `/etc/`). Manage with `node9 shield enable|disable|list|status`.
- **Shadow Git Snapshots (Phase 2):** (Coming Soon) Automatic lightweight git commits before AI edits, allowing `node9 undo`.

### Fixed

- **Cursor hook setup:** `node9 addto cursor` no longer attempts to write an unsupported `hooks.json` file. A clear warning is shown explaining that MCP proxy wrapping is the only supported protection mode for Cursor.
- **Empty shields file warning:** Suppressed a spurious parse warning that appeared on first run when `~/.node9/shields.json` existed but was empty.
- **`node9 tail` crash on daemon disconnect:** An unhandled `ECONNRESET` error on the readline interface no longer crashes the process — it exits cleanly with `❌ Daemon disconnected.`

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Multi-Channel Race Engine:** Node9 now fires all enabled approval channels simultaneously (Native Popup, Browser UI, Cloud/Slack, and Terminal). The first channel to receive a human signature wins and instantly cancels all other pending racers.
- **AI Negotiation Loop:** Replaced generic "Access Denied" errors with instructional feedback prompts. When blocked, Node9 injects a structured message into the LLM's context window, teaching the agent to apologize, explain its reasoning, or pivot to a safer alternative.
- **Native OS Dialogs:** Integrated sub-second, keyboard-navigable approval dialogs via `osascript` (macOS), `zenity` (Linux), and `PowerShell` (Windows).
- **Resolution Waterfall:** Implemented a strict 5-tier configuration precedence engine: `Environment Variables` > `Cloud (SaaS)` > `Project Config` > `Global Config` > `Defaults`.
- **Identity-Aware Execution:** The policy engine now distinguishes between a Human (`Terminal`) and an AI Agent (`Claude/Gemini`). Manual shell commands now benefit from "Nuclear-only" protection, while AI agents remain under "Zero Trust" restrictions.
- **Extended Hook Timeouts:** Default hook timeouts for Claude and Gemini have been increased to 10 minutes to support asynchronous Slack and remote approvals.
- **Sandbox Paths:** Added `policy.sandboxPaths` support. Any command operating strictly within defined safe zones (e.g., `/tmp/**`) is automatically allowed without human intervention.
- **Atomic File Writes:** Implemented `atomicWriteSync` for all state files (`decisions.json`, `trust.json`, `PAUSED`). This prevents JSON corruption during concurrent AI tool calls.

### Fixed

- **True Proxy Interception:** Rewrote the Proxy/MCP runner to intercept the Agent's `stdin` (requests) rather than just monitoring the Server's `stdout` (responses). Dangerous actions are now caught _before_ they reach the target server.
- **Port Conflict Resurrection:** The daemon now detects zombie PID files and `EADDRINUSE` errors, automatically clearing dead processes and resurrecting the server.
- **Credential Separation:** API keys are now strictly isolated in `~/.node9/credentials.json` and are never read from project-level config files to prevent accidental leakage to version control.

### Security

- **Waterfall Governance:** Cloud-level "Organization Policies" now act as a Master Lock, disabling local "Allow" buttons in the Native and Browser UIs when a remote manager signature is required.
- **Graceful Idle Timeout:** The background daemon now implements a 12-hour inactivity timer to automatically shut down and free system resources after use.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Local Approval Daemon:** `node9 daemon` starts a browser-based approval UI at `http://127.0.0.1:7391`. Approve, deny, or set persistent per-tool decisions ("Always Allow" / "Always Deny") without a Slack account.
- **Persistent Decisions Panel:** The daemon browser UI shows a `📋 Persistent Decisions` panel listing every "Always Allow" / "Always Deny" decision with a **Revoke** button. Revoking a decision removes it from `~/.node9/decisions.json` and updates all open tabs instantly via SSE.
- **`GET /decisions` endpoint:** Returns the current persistent decisions map (read-only, no CSRF required).
- **`DELETE /decisions/:toolName` endpoint:** Removes a persistent decision (requires `X-Node9-Token` CSRF header).
- **Auto-start Daemon:** When a dangerous call arrives and no approval mechanism is running, Node9 automatically starts the daemon and opens the browser — no manual setup required.
- **Browser-Close Fallback:** If the browser tab is closed mid-approval, Node9 waits 2 seconds (to allow for an accidental refresh), then abandons the request and falls back to a terminal Y/N prompt, then blocks if there is no TTY. The daemon shuts down cleanly after abandonment.
- **`autoStartDaemon` Setting:** Toggle daemon auto-start from the browser UI (⚙️ Settings) or via `settings.autoStartDaemon: false` in `~/.node9/config.json`. When disabled, dangerous commands fall back directly to a terminal prompt.
- **Smart Runner — Browser-First Flow:** `node9 "rm -rf ./data"` now prefers the browser popup over a plain terminal prompt. Terminal Y/N is only shown if the daemon fails to start. This makes the full approval UI available without pre-running `node9 daemon`.
- **Terminal Prompt Timeout:** The interactive Y/N approval prompt now auto-denies after 30 seconds if no response is given, preventing agents from hanging indefinitely when a human walks away.
- **Smart Runner:** Node9 intercepts the initial command you pass to it (e.g., `node9 "rm -rf /"`) and checks it against your security policy before execution.
- **Improved Gemini CLI Integration:** Fully supports the latest Gemini CLI hook schema (array-based `BeforeTool`/`AfterTool`).
- **Verbose Policy Debugging:** Added `~/.node9/hook-debug.log` to help troubleshoot hook payloads (`NODE9_DEBUG=1`).
- **`getGlobalSettings()` API:** Reads machine-level settings from `~/.node9/config.json` independently of project config, so daemon lifecycle preferences are never overridden by a project's policy file.

### Fixed

- **Case-Insensitive Tool Matching:** Tool names like `Shell`, `shell`, and `run_shell_command` are now correctly identified and intercepted regardless of casing.
- **Robust Hook Setup:** `node9 addto gemini` now automatically detects and fixes outdated object-based hook configurations in `settings.json`.
- **Duplicate Interception:** Fixed a bug where `run_shell_command` was in the default `ignoredTools` list, preventing it from being properly inspected. Also corrected the example `node9.config.json`.
- **`node9 check` stdin Hang:** The hook no longer hangs if the AI agent opens stdin but never sends EOF. A 5-second safety timeout ensures the process exits cleanly.
- **Smart Runner Terminal Prompt:** `allowTerminalFallback` was not being passed in the smart runner path, so the Y/N prompt never appeared. Now correctly shown when no daemon is running and a TTY is available.

### Security

- **CSRF Token on Daemon:** A per-run UUID token is embedded in the browser UI and required as `X-Node9-Token` on all state-changing requests (`POST /decision`, `POST /settings`). Prevents other local processes from silently approving pending actions.
- **Credentials File Permissions:** `~/.node9/credentials.json` is now written with `0o600` (owner read/write only).
- **Daemon Error Logging:** Handler errors in `/check`, `/decision`, and `/settings` are now logged to stderr when `NODE9_DEBUG=1`, making production debugging possible without exposing errors by default.

### Changed

- `node9 addto` now supports the new array-based hook structure for Gemini CLI.
- Updated internal `GeminiSettings` interfaces to match the latest CLI specifications.
